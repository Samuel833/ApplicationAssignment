    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I am <strong>Sowunmi Oluwasegun</strong> a student of <strong>Altschool Africa School of Engineering</strong> under the <strong>Frontend Track</strong> with a student ID of <strong>ALT/SOE/O23/3132</strong>and I would love to share a bit about my Journey at Altschool, my motivations and what I hope to achieve here.
    </p>
    <h1>Why AltSchool?</h1>
    <p>
      I enrolled at <strong>Altschool</strong> because of my passionate interest in <strong>Software Engineering</strong> and the endless possibilities it provides in the ever evolving Technoligical space and the world at large. My choice for Altschool is basically because of the reputation <strong>Altschool</strong> has for fostering innovation, creativity and a hands on approach to learning that will help develop my skills and knowledge and prepare me adequately to grab the oppurtunites available in the tech world.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would like to Apperciate Mr olwaseun Setemi our Tutor on the track who has so far made learning easy and a funthing to do for me. I find myself easily understanding concepts that were initialy hard to grasp for me before joining <strong>Altschool</strong>.
    </p>
    <h1>
      My Goal as an <strong>Altschooler</strong>
    </h1>
    <p>I recently finished university at the College pf Medicine, University of Lagos as a pharmacologist. I plan on using the knowledge I am gaining at <strong>Altschool</strong> to making the world a better place which primarily involve making healtcare easy and accesible to people. I plan on building sofatwares that teach people on the proper use of drugs and foster the access of affordable drugs and health personels, closing up on the barrier of distance, location, time and money.</p>
    <p>
      I have been putting all the works in to make sure I graduate with flying colours and I know by the end of this Journey I would have garned enough knowledge to launch me into the techspace. This is just the begining of a very bright, impactful and prosperous future. Cheers!
